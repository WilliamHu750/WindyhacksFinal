"description": "<h2><strong>Back End Developer</strong></h2>\n<p><strong>Software Development</strong> - Amsterdam Zuid - Oost</p>\n<p>Wij zijn <em>Workrate</em>: een snelgroeiend internationaal beveiligingsbedrijf gespecialiseerd in datacenter, haven en logistieke security. Wij staan niet graag stil. Workrate werkt voor klanten die hoge eisen stellen aan de dienstverlening in hun omgeving: 24/7 en 365 dagen per jaar. Continu spelen wij in op het vernieuwende karakter van de kwaliteit van dienstverlening én creëren de best mogelijke oplossingen. De term workrate komt uit de sportwereld en staat voor de inzet en werkintensiteit van een team. De workrate moet hoog zijn om effectief in te kunnen spelen op toekomstige spelsituaties. Dit principe past naadloos bij de filosofie van onze oprichters.</p>\n<p>Workrate is in Nederland marktleider in datacenter beveiliging. Naast de Nederlandse markt richt Workrate zich ook op de buitenlandse markt zoals het Verenigd Koninkrijk en Duitsland.</p>\n<p>Om het beveiligingsproces te ondersteunen heeft Workrate een Security Compliance Suite ontwikkeld, de Workstate. Naast de Workstate 1.0 is het development team volop bezig met de ontwikkeling van de Workstate 2.0 welke gefaseerd uitgerold wordt bij bestaande en nieuwe klanten. De development afdeling kan gezien worden als een start-up binnen een gevestigd bedrijf met korte lijnen en veel ruimte voor eigen ontwikkeling en initiatief.</p>\n<h2><strong>Aan welke/ wat voor projecten ga je werken?</strong></h2>\n<p>De backend developer zal aan ons 2.0 project werken die nu gelanceerd wordt. We verkopen deze tool, die is gericht op security processen, in heel EMEA en stelt de eindgebruikers in staat om elk proces te modelleren.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>De tool wordt ingezet voor onze eigen beveiligers</li>\n<li>Hij wordt ook aan onze klanten verkocht voor extra functionaliteit</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Als backend developer ben jij samen met het team verantwoordelijk voor de ontwikkeling en het onderhoud van de Security Compliance Suite. Hoe je dit bereikt bepalen jij en je collega’s zelf! Door de snelle technologische ontwikkelingen is er veel vrijheid om new cutting-edge technologies te testen en te implementeren. Er is geen manager die jou gaat uitleggen hoe je moet programmeren.</p>\n<h2><strong>Hoe ziet het team er verder uit?</strong></h2>\n<p>Er is geen directe aansturing. De product owner bewaakt de planning en de grote lijnen, jij bent samen met 2 andere back end developers verantwoordelijk voor het back end stuk. De rest van het team bestaat uit; 2 back end developers in dienst, 2 back end freelancers, 1 front end freelancer, een business consultant en een product owner.</p>\n<p>Daarbuiten bestaat het team van Workrate uit ongeveer 30 medewerkers in finance, HR, training &amp; consultancy en sales. Naast deze staf functies heeft de beveiligingstak nog 600 beveiligers in dienst die bij de klanten op locatie de beveiliging verzorgen.</p>\n<h2><strong>Wij zoeken iemand:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Met passie voor het vak, daarom ben je altijd op de hoogte van de laatste ontwikkelingen;</li>\n<li>Met interesse voor het delen van kennis en ideeën met je team;</li>\n<li>In staat is de behoefte van onze klanten te begrijpen en te vertalen naar technisch vernuftige oplossingen en deze vervolgens te bouwen;</li>\n<li>Die voldoening uit het schrijven van gestructureerde code;</li>\n<li>Die verantwoordelijkheid neemt en werkt op een zorgvuldige en resultaatgerichte manier.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Zijn er eisen qua opleidingsniveau?</strong></h2>\n<p>Wij geloven niet dat een opleiding leidend is voor een back end developer, dus autodidacten zijn ook van harte uitgenodigd te reageren. Enige ervaring als back end developer is uiteraard wel gewenst. Tijdens het sollicitatieproces zien we graag jouw portfolio om te zien waar jij toe in staat bent en aan welke projecten je in het verleden hebt gewerkt.</p>\n<h2><strong>De stack die je nodig hebt:</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Ervaring met PHP frameworks zoals Laravel of Symfony;</li>\n<li>Ervaring met Git;</li>\n<li>Ervaring met REST API’s is een pre;</li>\n<li>Ervaring met CI/CD is een pre;</li>\n<li>Innovatief, creatief en leergierig.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><strong>Tot slot</strong></h2>\n<p>We geven veel vrijheid, vertrouwen en mogelijkheden. Denk hierbij aan scholing, flexibele werktijden en een kosteloze gezamenlijke lunch. Dit typeert het werk bij Workrate direct.</p>\n<p>Naast een concurrerend marktconform salaris krijg je een Macbook Pro, groot scherm, toetsenbord en muis en een iPhone.</p>\n<p>Lijkt het je wat om bij een organisatie te werken die een uniek beveiligingsconcept verzorgt in diverse Europese steden (Amsterdam, Londen, Frankfurt en Genève) Een organisatie die onlangs is opgenomen in de Top 250 groeibedrijven in Nederland? Haal je graag het beste uit je zelf en gedij je goed in een dynamische omgeving? Stuur dan je CV en korte motivatie via het sollicitatieformulier. Heb je nog vragen?

"description": "<p>SUMMARY</p>\n<p>We’re looking for an extraordinary software engineer to join us at Rasa. The position offers the opportunity to have a huge impact at an early stage startup.  The point of this post is to provide enough information to let you decide whether to apply.</p>\n<p>ABOUT THIS ROLE</p>\n<p>Software Development at Rasa is not only about writing Code. You'll have to come up with good architectural designs, quality code, and break an ambitious long-term vision down into milestones and issues.</p>\n<p>We don’t draw a hard line between our engineering and research teams, we all work on the same stack and share work, knowledge, and tools. A lot of the code we create is open source and used by a large community of developers. The driver for our development efforts is this: what would help developers build great conversational software? What can we enable them to build that they couldn't do currently?</p>\n<p>We do fundamental machine learning research, and we ship commercial quality software that puts it to use. We mostly work in Python, but dip into other languages when it makes sense to. Because engineering is so close to research, you’ll quickly learn a lot about Machine Learning, Model Management, Data Analysis workflows, and what it takes to ship machine learning applications into production.</p>\n<p>We are looking for a software engineer who combines technical, communication, and analytical capabilities and who will have the opportunity to design and develop creative, compelling, and cutting-edge systems that support our mission.</p>\n<p>Please keep in mind that we are describing the background we imagine would best fit the role. Even if you don’t meet all the requirements, yet you are confident that you are up for the task, we absolutely want to get to know you!</p>\n<p>ABOUT YOU</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>You take pride in teaching and learning from teammates, and enjoy constructive peer review in a respectful environment</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You're comfortable being lean and fix problems without waiting for someone to tell you to</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can effectively communicate what you’re working on with non-technical team members</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Technical requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Experience taking a leading role in building complex software systems</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Experience teaching &amp; communicating technical material</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Advanced knowledge in Python or another programming language</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ability to think ahead and anticipate technological challenges</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>THINGS YOU WILL DO</p>\n<p>We’re a startup, so you’ll have to be comfortable rolling up your sleeves and doing whatever is required to support our mission. However, you can definitely expect to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Work on our open source projects alongside our large contributor base and community</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Architect, code &amp; test backend services to support machine learning training, prediction and annotation</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Improve the scalability &amp; performance of backend services for our enterprise customers which are handling high loads</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Lead junior developers who develop on our libraries develop great software engineering skills</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Work with driven people across all areas of the company—from marketing and business development to machine learning research and UX design—to create the tools to let all makers build AI assistants that everyone can use</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>ABOUT US</p>\n<p>At Rasa, we're building the standard infrastructure for conversational AI. With over half a million downloads since launch, our open source tools are loved by developers worldwide, and Rasa runs in production everywhere from startups to Fortune 500s. Our friendly community is growing fast, with developers from all over the world learning from each other and working together to make text- and voice-based AI assistants better.</p>\n<p>Rasa's machine learning-based dialogue tools allow developers to automate contextual conversations. What are contextual conversations? Real back-and-forth dialogue that is handled seamlessly. Taking AI assistants beyond fixed question / answer pairs creates exciting new use cases for people and business. The tip of the iceberg includes automation of sales &amp; marketing, internal processes, and advanced customer service that integrates into existing backend systems. With Rasa, companies control their own destiny, investing in AI that they own and ship instead of relying on third parties.</p>\n<p>Rasa has raised $14 million in total funding from Accel, Basis Set Ventures and open source founders such as Ross Mason (MuleSoft), Mitchell Hashimoto (Hashicorp) and Florian Leibert (Mesosphere). The company is headquartered in San Francisco, CA, with R&amp;D offices in Berlin, Germany and was founded in 2016.</p>\n<p>Rasa is an equal opportunity employer. We are still a small team and are committed to growing in an inclusive manner. We want to augment our team with talented, compassionate people irrespective of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, physical or mental disability, or age.</p>\n",
